Their seasonal migrations included hunting, fishing, and growing a variety of crops, but they returned to their longhouses during the winter. Abenaki built birch-bark canoes for water travel.\n\nThis tribal group includes the Penobscot and the Androscoggin. Abenakis fought against the English on the side of the French during the Seven Years' War from 1756 to 1763. After their defeat, many went north where they were welcomed by the French with gifts of land, and presently, there is a reserve in Saint Francis, Quebec."

They built light, flexible boats called kayaks. Aleuts built and lived in underground houses called barabaras. Barabaras were camouflaged to blend in with the surrounding ground, making them almost undetectable.\n\nAleuts made jewelry out of ivory, bone and feathers. Aleuts developed techniques for surviving harsh arctic winters. During the summers the Aleuts would travel inland to fish for salmon and live in temporary dwellings.\n\nToday Aleuts still live in Alaska, where 44 million acres of federal land was set aside for Alaska's Inuit and Aleut populations."

Fringed newts retrieve freshwater fruits from the bottom of the crystal pools for the jump gliders, who prefer this food to all other treats. In return, the horses fly the newts anywhere they wish to go. The newts themselves have large families that, over time, have spread out to the far corners of the world North of North and since they are very friendly creatures who love to visit each other, this form of travel is the fastest.

They are a curious species often looking about to see what’s-going-on, their heads can be seen sticking up out of the many pools that dot the landscape.

These otters have striking colors spanning the spectrum of blues and purples - their eyes are deep doey brown.\n\nObrylin is a breed of water horse called a pool diver. They spend the majority of their time lounging around pool rims of the Grassy. When threatened they will simply slip into the water and disappear. When night falls they retreat to underwater caves. These horses are very timid and though they can be seen from a distance few have seen one close up. Pool divers are sky blue in color and glow softly in the dark. Instead of hooves, the horses’ legs end in delicate fins and they have gills along their long necks. Their eyes are very large and black. Pool Divers are drawn to flute music and have been known to surface quite close to a gifted musician. Sometimes a pool diver will leave a large pearl from a giant freshwater oyster as a gift by a pool’s edge to reward a particularly good player."

They considered the Delaware (Lenape) their \"grandfathers.\" During the summer the Shawnee gathered into large villages of bark-covered long houses, with each village usually having a large council house for meetings and religious ceremonies. In the fall they separated to small hunting camps of extended families. Men were warriors who hunted and fished. Care of their corn fields was the responsibility of the women. Many important Shawnee ceremonies were tied to the agricultural cycle: the spring bread dance at planting time; the green corn dance when crops ripened; and the autumn bread dance to celebrate the harvest.\n\nChief Tecumseh is revered in their history as a war leader and prophet. He said:\n\n\"So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide. Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none. When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision. When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they week and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.\""

After the clay was shaped into a vessel, it was scraped smooth with a scraper. Then a thin layer of finer clay was applied to the surface for extra smoothness. Then the vessel was polished with a stone. After the piece was painted with home-made organic dyes using a yucca brush, the pottery was fired in kilns. During the firing, silence was observed in order to maintain the original \"voice\" of the \"being\" of the clay and its intended purpose. Selling pottery and other traditional arts and crafts is a major source of income for many of the Zuni, and an artisan may be the sole financial support for their immediate family as well as others. They make pottery, clothing, baskets, and Kachina dolls.\n\nThe cultural life of the Zuni people revolves around their religion, which is unique from the other Pueblo peoples. They venerate three deities: Earth Mother, Sun Father and Moonlight Giving Mother.
