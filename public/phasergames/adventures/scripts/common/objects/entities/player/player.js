// TODO : Figure out if it's better to handle entities in pure js class
// And just call func/vars from Phaser scene
// Or if we setup the player as a scene, or as a Phaser object (not really sure if they have
// anything that could work to have a Player entity)
// Whether we do one or the other, it's probably best to handle the npcs, items, plants,
// And maybe most of the interactive elements like this too?
