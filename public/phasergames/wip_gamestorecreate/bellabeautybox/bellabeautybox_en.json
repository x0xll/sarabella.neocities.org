With the blue arrows you can look through the whole wardrobe. Click on one of the small pictures and it will come up in the color picker at the top of the screen. There you can choose from 6 different color variants. If none of them fit your design, you can click and drag the color-handle and create your own color.<br/><br/>When you're satisfied with the color you can drag the from the color picker to the horse and click on the blue arrows to find more useful items.<br/><br/>Click the coat hanger again to hide the panels and click the letter-icon to send your design to a friend.
