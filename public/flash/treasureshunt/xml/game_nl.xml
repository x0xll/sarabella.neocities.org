	<how_to_play2>The further your mouse is from Treasure, the faster you'll move.

Electric eels and Jelly fish will zap you and cause you to move slowly.

Bubbles replenish your energy so you can move faster.

Schools of fish allow you to swim faster.

Pearls keep you safe from all danger for a short time.

The game is over when the bubble timer, located below your score, pops.</how_to_play2>

	<intro_howto>Use your mouse to guide Treasure through the open sea to collect special fish, shells, and other magical items before time runs out. Beware of the Jelly fish and electric eels!  They'll slow you down. Schools of fish and bubbles will help you move faster.</intro_howto>
