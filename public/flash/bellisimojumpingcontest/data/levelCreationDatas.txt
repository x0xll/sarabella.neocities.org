The game reads a .xml file to know which level to load. From what could be found in the game's code, there was apparently only 1 level available.

To create the level files, there are quite a few possible parameters, as well as a specific structure to respect, like shown below.

The structure needed for a level file is the following:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root length="int">
    <grid random="bool">
        <!-- Add as many as needed -->
        <track id="int/string" x="int" y="int" />
    </grid>

    <sections>
        <!-- Add as many as needed -->
        <section id="int/string" x="int" y="int">
            <!-- Add as many as needed -->
            <prop name="string" x="int" y="int">
                <!-- Change the tags depending on the ones needed -->
                <pos x="int" y="int" />
                <scale x="int" y="int" />
                <vel x="int" y="int" />
                <path name="string" /> <!-- Possibles values: straigth -->
                <layer value="string /> <!-- Possibles values: background, center, foreground -->
                <solid value="bool" />
                <collidable value="bool" />
                <destructable value="bool" />
                <pickup value="bool" />
            </prop>
        </section>
    </sections>
</root>

A few things to note:
    - Each track id should correspond to a section id
    - The bottom of the game view (between the black bars) is located at y = 0, going up means using negative numbers
    - To set an item from the starting point of the horse, the min x value to still have a pickup item show seems to be -9. 0 will be a lot closer to the right edge of the screen
    - The random argument of the grid element seems to use all the sections, and randomize them in the level (to verify through more tests)
    - The length argument on the root is the length of the level. Once the player reaches that position, it goes to the end/win screen
    - In the swf, the level file is loaded, and the level is created in the first DoAction of the frame 1 of the DefineSprite 836
    - The arguments for each tag seems to be more or less optional
    - When multiples hierarchy elements have values for x and y positions, those will be additioned
