    "devlog_summary" : "Here is the current state of the archiving of the Bella Sara website games:<br/><br/>We have successfully managed to locate and restore several of the original Flash games from the Bella Sara website thanks to archived pages and caches. These include <i>Art Studio</i>, <i>Cloud Jumper</i>, <i>Treasure's Hunt</i>, <i>Jigsaw Puzzle</i>, <i>Coloring Game (Fiona only)</i>, <i>Memory Game</i>, <i>Santo's Quiz</i>, the <i>Baby Bella ad</i>, and the old version of the <i>World Map</i>.<br/><br/>Additionally, we have partially recovered or restored the files for several other games, such as <i>Spectacular Jumping Game</i>, <i>Lance Riding</i>, <i>Storybook</i>, <i>My Horse (sprite only)</i>, <i>Firelight Festival</i>, <i>Dreamrider</i>, <i>BubbleWand</i>, and the newer version of the <i>World Map</i>. These games are still undergoing work to fully restore their original functionalities, and many games are missing files (e.g., the <i>Lance Riding</i> game is missing the files for the later levels).<br/><br/>We also found files for some other games, that we are trying on repairing to have them working again, such as <i>Citrustacked</i>, <i>Wheel of Wonders</i>, the newest version of <i>CloudJumper</i>, and <i>Marvelous Magic Match</i><br/><br/>Unfortunately, some games remain missing or seem to be permanently broken (e.g., <i>Bella's Beauty Box</i>). To address this, we have started recreating a few of these games using the Phaser framework. As of this update, the <i>Stables</i>, the <i>Spectacular Jumping Game</i>, <i>Yin and Yang's Memory Game</i> and <i>Belo's Quiz</i>are all available to play, although still as a work in progress. We are also currently working on recreating <i>Bellapedia</i>, which should hopefully be available soon.<br/><br/>Beyond restoring the original games, we have also started creating custom games inspired by the ones from the website. Currently, four are available: a <i>Random Art Idea Generator</i>, a <i>Dress-Up Game</i> based on the <i>Stables</i>, an <i>Adventures Quiz</i> and <i>Autumn Journey Quiz</i> based on <i>Belo's Quiz</i>. We are also considering of soon recreating <i>Wheel of Wonders</i>, <i>Marvelous Magic Match</i>, <i>Bella's Beauty Box</i>, and even a first prototype for <i>Adventures</i>.<br/><br/>We do hope to eventually restore or recreate all the games from the site if we can, but this will obviously take time.
