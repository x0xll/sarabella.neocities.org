                    Here is the current state of the archiving of the Bella Sara website games:

                    <br/><br/>

                    We have successfully managed to locate and restore several of the original Flash games from the Bella Sara website. These include <i>Cloud Jumper</i>, <i>Treasure's Hunt</i>, <i>Jigsaw Puzzle</i>, <i>Coloring Game (Fiona only)</i>, <i>Memory Game</i>, <i>Santo's Quiz</i>, the <i>Baby Bella ad</i>, and the old version of the <i>World Map</i>.

                    <br/><br/>
                    
                    Additionally, we have partially recovered or restored the files for several other games, such as the <i>Art Studio</i>, <i>Lance Riding</i>, <i>Storybook</i>, <i>My Horse (sprite only)</i>, <i>Firelight Festival</i>, and the newer version of the <i>World Map</i>. These games are still undergoing work to fully restore their original functionalities, and many games are missing files (e.g., the <i>Lance Riding</i> game is missing the files for the later levels).

                    <br/><br/>
                    
                    Unfortunately, some games remain missing or seem to be permanently broken (e.g., <i>Bella's Beauty Box</i>). To address this, we have started recreating a few of these games using the Phaser framework. As of this update, the <i>Stables</i>, the <i>Spectacular Jumping Game</i>, <i>Yin and Yang's Memory Game</i> and <i>Belo's Quiz</i>are all available to play, although still as a work in progress. We are also currently working on recreating <i>Citrustacked</i>, <i>Bellapedia</i>, and <i>Bellisimo's Jumping Contest</i>, which should all hopefully be available soon.

                    <br/><br/>
                    
                    Beyond restoring the original games, we have also started creating custom games inspired by the ones from the website. Currently, two are available: a <i>Random Art Idea Generator</i>, a <i>Dress-Up Game</i> based on the <i>Stables</i> and an <i>Adventures Quiz</i> and <i>Autumn Journey Quiz</i> based on <i>Belo's Quiz</i>.

                    <br/><br/>
                    
                    We do hope to eventually restore or recreate all the games from the site if we can, but this will obviously take time. If you would like to help us out or would like a more detailed overview of this project, we would recommend starting here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBfcP9EkCo5xfitKNe5eN3yD4qw-AlGIIEu3l_4htho/edit?tab=t.0." target="_blank">Bella Sara Archival Notes</a>. This project is a community effort and every little bit helps!
